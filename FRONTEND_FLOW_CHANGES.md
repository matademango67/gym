# Frontend Flow Reorganization

## Summary of Changes

The frontend flow has been reorganized to match the backend business logic with minimal changes to the existing codebase.

## New Navigation Flow

```
Authentication (Login/Register)
    ↓
Customer Profile Check
    ↓
Create Customer (only if no profile exists)
    ↓
Dashboard/Main Application
```

## Files Modified

### 1. `frontend/src/App.jsx`
- Added route for `/customer/create` with `CreateCustomerPage` component
- Changed root redirect from `/dashboard` to `/login` (authentication first)
- Imported new `CreateCustomerPage` component

### 2. `frontend/src/context/AuthContext.jsx`
- Imported `customerService` to check customer profiles
- Added `hasCustomerProfile` state to track customer profile status
- Added `checkCustomerProfile()` function that calls `GET /customer` endpoint
- Exported new state and function through context

### 3. `frontend/src/pages/LoginPage.jsx`
- Imported `checkCustomerProfile` from auth context
- After successful login, checks if user has customer profile
- Routes to `/dashboard` if profile exists
- Routes to `/customer/create` if no profile exists

## Files Created

### 4. `frontend/src/pages/CreateCustomerPage.jsx` (NEW)
- Form with two fields: name, birth date
- **No user_id field** - backend automatically adds it from JWT token
- **No email field** - backend gets email from authenticated user
- Validates all fields before submission
- Calls `POST /customer` with `{name, birth}`
- Redirects to dashboard on success

## Backend Alignment

The frontend now correctly follows the backend logic:

1. **Authentication**: `POST /auth/login` or `POST /auth/register`
2. **Customer Check**: `GET /customer` (requires auth token)
3. **Customer Creation**: `POST /customer` with `{name, birth, email}` (user_id from JWT)
4. **Dashboard**: `GET /membership/me` and other protected routes

## Key Features

- ✅ Authentication always starts first
- ✅ Login and Register both work correctly
- ✅ "Create Account" button and "Don't have an account?" text perform same action
- ✅ No user_id requested from user (backend handles it)
- ✅ Customer profile check after login
- ✅ Automatic redirect based on profile existence
- ✅ Minimal changes to existing code
- ✅ No styling changes
- ✅ All existing API calls preserved
- ✅ Build successful with no errors

## API Endpoints Used

- `POST /auth/register` - User registration
- `POST /auth/login` - User login
- `GET /customer` - Check if customer profile exists
- `POST /customer` - Create customer profile
- `GET /membership/me` - Fetch user's memberships (dashboard)

## Validation

- Customer name: required, max 30 characters
- Birth date: valid date, must be between 1935-01-01 and 2011-01-01 (15+ years old)
- Email: not required (backend uses authenticated user's email)
- All validation matches backend Zod schema
